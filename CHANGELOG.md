##V1.0, 14th August 2023, MB
I am adding a bibliography file for references for the whole repository, creating new table figures based on changes to the reference list, and creating new gifs as examples to reflect the changes to the reference list. 
I have changed the corresponding underlying technical and Bio/Env metadata tables to include references and added a reference list for biomes in the main README file. 
Adding hyperlinks throughout the text makes navigating through the repository easier. 
I reworked the introduction text to reflect the purpose of the repository better and added a license badge at the beginning of it. 
Esthetic changes to the repository to make it visually appealing and easier to navigate through. 
Added LICENSE, CHANGELOG, and NEXT_VERSION files.
