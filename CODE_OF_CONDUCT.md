# Code of Conduct

To keep it simple: Be nice.

To be a bit more explicit: We are borrowing [The Carpentries' well-phrased suggestions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) and encourage the following kinds of behaviours:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show courtesy and respect towards each other

See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

## Code of Conduct of the association Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFD) e.V.

### General Principles of Cooperation

As members of the association [Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur (NFDI) e.V.](https://www.nfdi.de/), we are committed 
to the association's goals of establishing and further developing an overarching research data 
management system in Germany and thereby increasing the efficiency of the entire German science 
system. We pursue its interests collectively. We strive for constructive cooperation and contribute to 
the reputation of the association through our personal actions. In our concrete cooperation, we are 
helped in particular by observing the following points:

#### Appreciative and Respectful Interaction

NFDI stands for mutual appreciation. Therefore, we cultivate an appreciative and respectful interaction 
in our daily work. We live a work culture in which each person can develop with his or her abilities and 
thus create an atmosphere of mutual recognition and openness. Our daily interaction is characterized 
by the fact that we value the performance and contribution of each individual to the NFDI Association. 
We encourage each other to be constructively critical. Disagreements are important and allowed, but 
are not an excuse for bad behavior or bad manners. We avoid allowing temporary stress or frustration 
to lead to hurtful behavior. A community can only be productive when the people who live and -work 
together do not feel uncomfortable, threatened or hurt. We therefore expect all people involved in NFDI 
to treat each other with respect and appreciation.

#### Cooperative Interaction 

We are one NFDI: We create synergy effects through equal participation and joint work of all partner 
organizations on cross-sectional topics, in sections and through growing, mutual understanding in the 
network. Consequently, NFDI is about collaboration and working together as equals. We know that we 
need to join forces to achieve our goals together. We support each other in achieving our goals, respect 
individual competencies and needs, and thus create the basis for working in a spirit of trust and 
respect.


Science and innovation thrive on open and constructive dialog. Only where a critical exchange is 
possible can old approaches be questioned and new ideas developed. We therefore live a working 
culture in which processes are openly discussed and constructive criticism is practiced.
Wherever people work together on ambitious projects, conflicts, tensions and differences of opinion 
arise - and NFDI is no exception. The decisive factor in such conflicts and disagreements is that they 
are not avoided, but are brought to a factual and constructive resolution. We address the resolution of 
conflicts promptly in order to resolve them in the best interests of all parties involved and to maintain 
a good working atmosphere.


That is why we foster a culture in which people with different perspectives and backgrounds meet as 
equals. We respect and allow different ideas and opinions. Even in the case of controversial topics and 
opposing positions, we enter into an open and solution-oriented dialog with each other.

#### Transparent and Open Work Culture

We do not want to hush up mistakes or cover up problems. Instead, we live an open and positive error 
culture in which errors are accepted in order to bring about improvements and innovations. Therefore, 
we cultivate a constructive approach to challenges and errors that arise, in order to be able to eliminate 
weaknesses and develop new approaches to solutions. In order to ensure an open working atmosphere 
and good working conditions, we live this error culture in our daily interaction - across all hierarchical 
levels. We also see ourselves as a role model for others. That is why we communicate openly, act in a 
motivating manner and always show appreciation for our counterparts. We strive to communicate our 
actions and decisions in a way that is understandable to others. We attach great importance to factual 
comprehensibility in all relevant decision-making processes.

#### Equal Opportunities, Diversity, Cosmopolitanism, Tolerance

In the NFDI, people with individual personalities, talents, life situations, experiences and backgrounds 
come together. We see this diversity as our great strength and a decisive factor in the success of our 
association. Through national and international networking, we contribute to intercultural cooperation.
We cultivate a considerate cooperation that is characterized by mutual acceptance. We emphasize that 
there is no place in NFDI for any form of sexism, racism, insults, bullying or sexual harassment. We do 
not tolerate such behavior in our ranks. We all contribute to actively counteracting such violations.
